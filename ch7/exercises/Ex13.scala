/*
    13. An export statement can appear inside a class, object, or 
    trait, or at the top level. If it appears in a class, how does 
    it differ from an import? What if it appears at the top level?

    1. If an export appears within a class, users of the class will
       have access to the exported members.

    2. If an export appears at the top level, users who import the 
       module will be able to use whatever is exported.
